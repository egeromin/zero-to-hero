Before fixing initialisations
Step 196000: validation loss = 2.2601, validation accuracy = 32.07%
Final test loss = 2.2696, test accuracy = 31.82%

After adding embedding into regularisation
Step 200000: validation loss = 2.4116, validation accuracy = 29.29%
Final test loss = 2.4192, test accuracy = 28.95%
WORSE, REJECTED.

After adding more hidden layers
Step 200000: validation loss = 2.2996, validation accuracy = 31.19%
Final test loss = 2.3032, test accuracy = 31.49%
ACCEPTED FOR NOW DESPITE REGRESSION, for educational purposes
of having multiple hidden layers. Will revert again later.
